WrinklyNinja's libespm Fork
===========================

The purpose of this fork is so that I can make changes to deaths_soul's libespm that make it more useful for BOSS.

Ideas:
    - Reduce memory usage. Currently libespm runs out of memory before it can finish loading big plugins like Skyrim.esm
    - Make it possible to use libespm with multiple games' plugins at the same time, ie. no global settings.
    - Object-orientate the interface, it makes more sense if a constructor for a File object loads a file, rather than a separate function.
    - Swap out the configuration file stuff with a YAML-based config file, and add the ability to specify config parameters in code.
    - Fix crashes on loading certain plugins:
      - Skyrim.esm
      - Tamriel Compendium.esp
      - Tamriel Compendium - Skill Books.esp
      The crashes have something to do with memory usage, the loading might just be inefficient, or it might be getting stuck somewhere.
