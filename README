WrinklyNinja's libespm Fork
===========================

The purpose of this fork is so that I can make changes to deaths_soul's libespm that make it more useful for BOSS.

Memory usage improvements, elimination of global settings, OOP interface, YAML-based settings file and crash fixes have been implemented in src/playground.h.

playground.h requires yaml-cpp and zlib.
