Coming soon:

Extraction of record content from ESP/ESMs.
--Getting there. Still needs to be integrated with everything else and have compression being handled before this can be called 'done'. 10/02/2012
Extraction of the useful data from ESS files.
--Variables are now supported, 05/31/2012
Code to generate the struct representing the file format for any all games (including future ones) using the ESP/ESM format. This is possible since they use a similar basic structure. One can use this structure to create a skeleton of the file format and then parse through using the predefined format of lengths and sizes of fields to create the actual file struct that will be used per game. The records are gained by using the format the is consistent across all 5 games at the moment.
--Basic code is getting there. 10/02/2012
Handling the compression for ESP/ESMs to allow for the reading of all of the data.
-->Add the rest of the variables to the structs. (Will take place after the compression handling)
-->Write up the functions to open the file and all that jazz. (Will take place after the compression handling)
---->Determine what else needs to be done for the basic handling. (Will take place after the above up to the compression handling)


Not coming soon but planned:

Update the documentation.

A lot of stuff. XD


Somewhere on the timeline:

Another overhaul of the organization of the code.
